              <li id="pub-summary">This paper estimates the effects of reduced hours and job loss on criminal offense using administrative court records matched to a large class of payroll and credit data from 2000-2011 in Texas.  I find that crime increases drastically after a negative employment shock, particularly among young men and those with lower income and worse credit.  Effects are exacerbated when looking specifically at economically-motivated crime and are sensitive to local economic conditions.  These effects persist even in instances of partial separation and do not fully abate even when an individual is reattached to the labor market.  I find that these crime responses are particularly pronounced in the months immediately following displacement - a finding that is obscured by aggregation or data standards in prior settings.  Costs to the state associated with depressed employment opportunities and increased propensity for crime are large, but heterogeneous.</li>

              <li id="pub-summary">We leverage variation in the timing of permanent housing recipiency by homeless individuals in Los Angeles County to determine the effects of housing the homeless on their employment, earnings, and benefits absorption. Placement into 2-year Rapid Re-Housing increases extensive-margin labor market participation by 60\% from a baseline of 15pp, while Permanent Supportive Housing recipients exhibit no change. We perform a cost-benefit analysis of these programs and estimate the net public cost of placing an individual into Rapid Re-Housing at approximately zero Dollars, whereas placing an individual into Permanent Supportive Housing costs approximately USD 150,000 per 10 years per recipient.</li>

              <li id="pub-summary">This paper attempts to recover the causal effects of criminal debt assigned at sentencing (LFOs) on subsequent criminal behavior.  We construct an estimator that uses judge stringency as an instrumental variable.  Additionally utilizing the uniform criminal sentencing guidelines in North Carolina since 2009, we circumvent part of the ``multi-dimensionality'' problem that would otherwise make estimation of this this relationship infeasible.  Preliminary evidence shows that \$100 of additionally assigned debt decreases the probability that an individual will reoffend within 12 months by 0.6-0.7pp (1.4-1.8%), though this estimate likely masks significant heterogeneity.  This is in contrast to OLS estimates, which predict a (zero or) positive relationship between assigned debt and subsequent reoffense.  We explore mechanisms that may explain this difference.</li>

              <li id="pub-summary">I outline how standard one-sided censoring problems in decentralized data systems present themselves in a variety of common settings.  Using administrative State and Federal criminal data in North Carolina and Texas, as well as data informing residence in other states, I show that this one-sided censoring is broadly non-random in the crime setting.  This non-random outcome censoring results in biased estimates using standard procedures, but can be corrected using additional information.  Unsurprisingly, this bias shrinks as the data becomes more uniform or complete.</li>
