              <li id="pub-summary">This paper estimates the effects of reduced hours and job loss on criminal offense using administrative court records matched to a large class of payroll and credit data from 2000-2011 in Texas.  I find that crime increases drastically after a negative employment shock, particularly among young men and those with lower income and worse credit.  Effects are exacerbated when looking specifically at economically-motivated crime and are sensitive to local economic conditions.  These effects persist even in instances of partial separation and do not fully abate even when an individual is reattached to the labor market.  I find that these crime responses are particularly pronounced in the months immediately following displacement - a finding that is obscured by aggregation or data standards in prior settings.  Costs to the state associated with depressed employment opportunities and increased propensity for crime are large, but heterogeneous.</li>
