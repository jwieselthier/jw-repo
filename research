              <li id="pub-summary">This paper estimates the effects of reduced hours and job loss on criminal offense using administrative court records matched 
		      to a large class of payroll and credit data from 2000-2011 in Texas.  I find that crime increases drastically after a negative employment shock, 
		      particularly among young men and those with lower income and worse credit.  Effects are exacerbated when looking specifically at economically-motivated 
		      crime and are sensitive to local economic conditions.  These effects persist even in instances of partial separation and do not fully abate even when an 
		      individual is reattached to the labor market.  I find that these crime responses are particularly pronounced in the months immediately following 
		      displacement - a finding that is obscured by aggregation or data standards in prior settings.  Costs to the state associated with depressed employment 
		      opportunities and increased propensity for crime are large but heterogeneous.</li>

		      (with Jakob Brounstein)</a></h4>
              <li id="pub-summary">We leverage variation in the timing of permanent housing recipiency by homeless individuals in Los Angeles County to determine the 
		      effects of housing the homeless on their employment, earnings, and benefits absorption. Placement into 2-year Rapid Re-Housing increases 
		      extensive-margin labor market participation by 60% from a baseline of 15pp, while Permanent Supportive Housing recipients exhibit no change. 
		      We perform a cost-benefit analysis of these programs and estimate the net public cost of placing an individual into Rapid Re-Housing at approximately zero Dollars, 
		      whereas placing an individual into Permanent Supportive Housing costs approximately USD 150,000 per 10 years per recipient.</li>

              <li id="pub-summary">This paper attempts to recover the causal effects of criminal debt assigned at sentencing (LFOs) on subsequent criminal behavior.  
		      We construct an estimator that uses judge stringency as an instrumental variable.  Additionally utilizing the uniform criminal sentencing guidelines 
		      in North Carolina since 2009, we circumvent part of the ''multi-dimensionality'' problem that would otherwise make estimation of this relationship infeasible.  
		      Preliminary evidence shows that $100 of additionally assigned debt decreases the probability that an individual will reoffend within 12 months by 0.6-0.7pp (1.4-1.8%), 
		      though this estimate likely masks significant heterogeneity.  This is in contrast to OLS estimates, which predict a (zero or) positive relationship between 
		      assigned debt and subsequent reoffense.  We explore mechanisms that may explain this difference.</li>

              <li id="pub-summary">I outline how standard one-sided censoring problems in decentralized data systems present themselves in a variety of common settings.  
		      Using administrative State and Federal criminal data in North Carolina and Texas, as well as data informing residence in other states, I show that this one-sided 
		      censoring is broadly non-random in the crime setting.  This non-random outcome censoring results in biased estimates of recidivism using standard procedures, but can be corrected 
		      using additional information.  Unsurprisingly, this bias shrinks as the data becomes more uniform or complete.</li>

	      		(with Amy Lerman, Meredith Sadin, and William Morrison)</a></h4>
              <li id="pub-summary"> We test the effects of assignment to a collaborative model of post-release community supervision (PRCS), which emphasizes release planning, 
		      prioritizes the officer-client relationship, and invites the client to actively participate in their reentry process.  
		      We find that clients randomly assigned to the collaborative model are 17pp more likely to report to their first probation meeting within the required 48 hours 
		      following release.  In the longer term, we find that intervention clients are 14pp less likely to have their probation revoked in the year following release.  
		      Our results broadly demonstrate that a collaborative model of post-release community supervision helps high-risk clients successfully complete their supervision term.</li>

	      <h4 id="pub-title">CCT Killed the RDD Star(s)?</h4>
              <li id="pub-summary"> One drawback to the regression discontinuity design is that the estimators require a choice of
		bandwidth, which is often chosen ad hoc.  There are several bandwidth selectors in the literature; however,
		most follow a procedure that leads to bias in the distributional approximation of the estimator.  Calonico,
		Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) propose adjusted confidence intervals for regression discontinuity treatment effects
		that are robust to large bandwidths.  In this short paper, I analyze how this procedure impacts the findings of a number of widely influential quasi-experiments.</li>

	      <h4 id="pub-title">The Los Angeles Riots, Recovery, and Misallocation</h4>
              <li id="pub-summary"> In the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, the city embarked on a recovery and revitalization effort, aiming to address
	      the systemic issues that underpinned the riots.  A significant component of this recovery strategy was the establishment of the Los Angeles Revitilization
	      Zones (LARZ), a policy initiative designed to revitalize the most affected areas.  This paper investigates the impact of these riots on subsequent revitalization efforts.
	      Precise data on arrests and structural damage is utilized to measure exposure, while distance from pre-determined command posts is utilized as an instrument for 
	      this exposure.  Riot exposure is found to significantly reduce household income, individual income, and measures of local investment 10 years out.  LARZ assignment is shown to
	      be misallocated under mild assumptions regarding the social planner's objective function.</li>
